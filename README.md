Student Information System with an SQLite Database

You are allowed to save your course name, course id, ects grade, letter grade and term.
You can view,delete,insert with given buttons.
With SQLite Database these informations are saved and you can load them with LOAD button whenever you like.
This is a Object Oriented Programming Project at the last semester of second year in Uskudar University.
I made this by working alone in a day.
